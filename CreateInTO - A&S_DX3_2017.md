# Team Ideation

[Adam & Spence Kickoff](assets/videos/adam_spence_edit.mp4)
<video src="assets/adam_spence_edit.mp4"></video>

1. Identify outcomes and objectives - "can I buy THAT"?
2. Target budget and timeline
3. Team brief
4. Ideation, presentation and proposals


* Great way to bring the team together creatively
* Bad way to define tightly scoped high-value activations

# The Monster Maker: a study in MVP

![](assets/monster_maker.png "Monster Maker plan")

Original vision:
* Activate the experience by touching van de Graaf ball
* Spin up a large crank - hair stands on end
* After #revs, show "reflection" in a digital mirror
* Take snapshot and capture surprise
* Show snapshot in a gallery

> What could possibly go wrong?

Revised vision:

# Lessons Learned

* prototype everything
* Electronics are HARD

[Soldering Station Malfunction video](assets/videos/soldering.mp4)

* Physical components are HARDER
* Dry run your dry run
* And then change NOTHING... unless you have to
